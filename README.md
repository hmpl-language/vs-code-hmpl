- **Bracket Matching**: Support for auto-closing and matching of HTML-like tags.
- **Seamless Theme Integration**: Compatible with all VS Code themes that support HTML.
- **Custom File Icons**: `.hmpl` files are displayed with a unique icon in the VS Code file explorer for easy identification.

2. Search for "HMPL" and click **Install**.
3. Once installed, open any file with the `.hmpl` extension, and the syntax highlighting will be applied automatically.

## Usage
